high priority:
1. implement initiation in TerminalZipVC
2. implement structure generation in NonTerminalZipVC

low priority:
1. read up on reflection - can probably avoid a lot of unchecked casting

others:
1. create an overleaf document with pacmpl template
2. write a paper for conference - needs more explanation and less technicality

current breakages:
1. NonTerminalZipVC vector clocks are breaking
2. test TerminalZipVC computeClocks
3. find a way to add the TOTAL number of locks into the system.
